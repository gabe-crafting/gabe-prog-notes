    - Unit testing: Validate the behavior of function, classes, components, methods (Given an input, check if the output is expected)
    - Integration testing
    - End to end testing: Run your app in a simulated environment: Cypress
    - acceptance testing: tests that ensure the software meets all the clients requirement
    - system testing: Tests that work on required hardware/servers
    - smoke testing: Most important tests first before the rest of the suit
    - stress testing: capability of infrastructure

  Test driven development
  #description
    - Have a pipeline that run the tests before making the commit
    - Write tests before start coding
    - Refactor -> Fail -> Pass -> Refactor (till all pass)
    - tool: jest
    
    ##### Integration testing
    - Testing multiple units of code together.
    - Not just input and output. See if a function has been called the right way, as many time as needed with the correct parameters, the component has been mounted and so on
    - Ex: Component that takes data from a hook. Check if it displayed properly in the component
    - Ex: API getters that integrates with the application. Proper errors are integrated, proper result display and so on.

  Jest
  #description
    - [Mock functions](https://jestjs.io/docs/mock-function-api): function that you can pass as a callback to test other function. You can watch details about the callback. How many time it was run and what parameters where passed into it. 
        - you can acces the watch method intel with `.mock` attribute ex `mockFn.mock.calls`, `mockFn.mock.results`
        - `spyOn` to also track the methods
    - Setup and Teardown: You can set prepearment methods: what will happen before/after testing, for everything or just scoped
    - The Jest Object: Automatically in scope in every test file. Provides the functionality, `test`, `it`, `describe`, etc.

  #description
    Rest: A web arhitecture that is based on client sending a request and getting a response.Methods:
    - [GET](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET) retrieve data from server
    - [POST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST) cause a change
    - [PUT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT) replace all the target with the payload
    - [PATCH](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PATCH) apply partial modification
    - [DELETE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE) deletes the specific resource

  Browser user data storage & database
  #description
    - [sessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage) ends when browser session ends
    - [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) no expiration time
    - [cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) Any data about user that is stored in a session level (server side)

    Crud: all ways that you can operate a store data (used in databases): create, read, update, delete

  [Webhook](https://www.getvero.com/resources/webhooks/)

  #description
    - [video reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfzucn4f9Xk)
    - your frontend uses a third party webhook service provider + the webhookEndpoint
        - by accessing it's frontend
        - by sending it a request for a service
    - the third webhook provider party executes the action then sends a payload (usually a 200) to the sended webhookEndpoint (your backend)
    - your backend notify your frontend that action is completed (most prob with a SSE / sockets)

  Server-Sent Events (SSE)

  #description
    [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events) is a web technology that pushes text event to the browser

    - Unidirectional communication: SSE allows the server to push data to the client (web browser) without the need for the client to make additional requests.
    - uses EventSource to declear the listened link
    - Automatic reconnection
    - Event-driven: Data sent through SSE is organized into named events
    - Text-based data transmission (including objects)

  WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication):

  #description
    Powerful set of APIs that enable real-time communication directly between web browsers without the need for plugins or intermediary servers. WebRTC is primarily used for peer-to-peer audio, video, and data sharing applications.

  [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)

  #description
    - Protocol: WebSocket operates over a single, full-duplex TCP connection.
    - Bidirectional Communication: Allows data to be sent and received simultaneously between client and server.
    - Real-time Updates: Ideal for applications requiring live updates and instant communication.
    - Efficiency: Reduces overhead by maintaining a persistent connection.
    - inspect them in networking by checking ws

  GraphQl

  #description
    - Query language for APIs, Client's query for certain data, returns requested data in a JSON-like format
    - Allows clients to request specific data they need
    - Defined by a schema describing data types, fields, and relationships
    - Single endpoint for querying
    - Hierarchical queries mirror data structure
    - Supports mutations for creating, updating, or deleting data
    - Subscriptions for real-time updates
    - Optimizing data fetching in complex applications
    - Simplifies API interactions with a single endpoint
    - Type safety and validation of queries
