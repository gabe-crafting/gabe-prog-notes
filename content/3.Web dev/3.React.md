# React
Some cheatsheets for react, also more easely access the docs

## Hooks
- [useState](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState#usestate) you can declear state, a getter and a setter
- [useContext](https://react.dev/reference/react/useContext) deconstruct the context from in children components
- [useCallback](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback) keep the method between rerenders
- [useMemo](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo) keep the value calculated til dependency change
- [useRef](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef) reference a value that is not needed for rendering
- [useLayoutEffect](https://react.dev/reference/react/useLayoutEffect) runs synchronously immediately after React has performed all DOM mutations (before rendering the component so you can set CSS, usually used with css-in-j)
- [useId](https://react.dev/reference/react/useId) creates an unique ID
- [useTransition](https://react.dev/reference/react/useTransition) returns the startTransition method and a flag that tells you when transitions are in pending.
- [useImperativeHandle](https://react.dev/reference/react/useImperativeHandle): allow you to use the bound ref in the component passed in forwardRef high-order component

## Api (optimization)
- [lazy](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy#usage) loads a component when it's needed
```ts
import { lazy } from 'react';

const MarkdownPreview = lazy(() => import('./MarkdownPreview.js'));
```
- [memo](https://react.dev/reference/react/memo) creates a high order component that renders only on props change, not with the parent
```ts
const SomeComponent = memo(function SomeComponent(props) { });
```
- [startTransition](https://react.dev/reference/react/startTransition) takes a callback named transition. In a transition Updates function like setState can be intrerupted by calling the update somewhere else. Use it to not make the user do mandatory heavy fetches once he triggered an action.
- [forwardRef](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef) assign refs in the children components

## Fast implementation

### debounce, debouncing, useDebounce ###
fetch data at a repeatable action (like a keypress or input change). To shorten the load you will add a time
```ts
export default function useDebounce(value, delay) {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value)
    }, delay)

    return () => clearTimeout(timeoutId)
  }, [value])

  return debouncedValue;
}

const debouncedValue = useDebounce(value, 500)
//now you can do use effect on this one
```

## Debuging

- Rendering: There's a checkbox well hidden in the React DevTools settings that allows you to visually highlight the components that rerendered. To enable it, go to "Profiler" >> click the "Cog wheel" on the right side of the top bar >> "General" tab >> Check the "Highlight updates when components render." [here](https://jsramblings.com/how-to-check-if-your-component-rerendered-and-why/)

## React testing

Jest: usually used for assertion and function checking. It can be integrated with react because you can test react native methods, but isn't made directly for it

## Good practice
[References](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaHnww6I5Y8) *debouncing, conditional rendering, forward refs*
- Use [conditional_operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_operator) for rendering components, not [logical conjunction](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND) : `{flag ? (<div></div>) : null}`
- Use deboucing: something like this. You can make a hook with useTimeout
